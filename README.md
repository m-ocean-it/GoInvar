# GoInvar: encoding invariants with types

Examples of using the library can be found [here](https://github.com/m-ocean-it/GoInvarCollection).

The library allows you to define *invariant holders*, i.e. types of elements that upheld specified conditions, or invariants. The invariants are checked upon initialization and subsequent unwrapping of holders.
